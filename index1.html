			<h3>Step 1</h3>
			<p>Gather the materials. To start writing calligraphy, you need to gather the basic materials</p>
			<br>

			<h3>Step 2</h3>
			<p>Choose a pen. For calligraphy, you have different pen options. You can use a brush pen, a fountain or cartridge pen, or a dip pen.</p>
			<br>

			<h3>Step 3</h3>
			<p>Choose practice paper. Because of the kind of ink used in calligraphy, regular paper is not the best choice. </p>
			<br>

			<h3>Step 4</h3>
			<p>Make practice lines on your paper. When writing calligraphy, you want to have straight lines to write on.</p>

			<h3>Tip #1 Start Learning with the Right Supplies</h3>
			<p>Would-be calligraphers often abandon their interest in the art after they try out cheap, readymade calligraphy kits. It’s important to remember, though, that kit manufacturers generally compromise material quality to make a profit. Oftentimes, the supplies included in these kits aren’t well suited for beginners! Plastic oblique pens can lead to unnecessary frustration, and high-flex nibs result in ink spatters and pressure exertion issues. Also, paper matters so much! Ordinary printer paper soaks up ink like crazy, which results in fuzzy, unclear strokes.</p>
			<br>

			<h3>Tip #2 Gradually Add to Your Calligraphy Collection</h3>
			<p>Birthdays and holidays are an amazing motivator to create some of your best work! There’s a big incentive in making someone you care about feel special with handmade work. Plus, you have a deadline — which is helpful to those of us who aren’t so great at finishing projects!</p>
			<br>


			<h3>Tip #3 Embrace Birthdays and Holidays as Practice Opportunities</h3>
			<p>Once you have mastered calligraphy with the basic supplies, you’re ready to start growing a collection. There are all sorts of nibs, inks, papers, and pens out there! A word of caution: resist the temptation to buy a lot of things at once. Instead, add to your collection with intention. Acquire just a few supplies every so often, and allow yourself some time to get acquainted with those supplies.</p>
			<br>

			<h3>Tip #4 Don’t Let the Pros Discourage You</h3>
			<p>I post on Instagram every day, and many times, I’ll receive self-depreciating compliments from people that make me cringe. Comments like “I could never do that,” pop up a lot. Those sorts of comments make me worry that people will get discouraged and stop trying. I mean, truly: I want you to remember that, first of all, everyone starts somewhere. Every single calligrapher was once at your skill level.</p>
			<br>

			<h3>Tip #5 Take Photos</h3>
			<p>As you create more and more calligraphy, your skill level will improve. It happens so gradually, though, that it’s difficult to notice. Keeping a photographic record helps you to clearly see your progress!</p>
			<br>

			<h3>Tip #6 Remember That the Pursuit of Perfection Will Lead to Disappointment</h3>
			<p>Even if you’re not comparing yourself to others, you’ll often hear a nagging voice of critique in your head as you work on projects. The voice may tell you that your letters look juvenile or that you made your “B” too big. It will pick the project apart until you look at it and only see imperfections.</p>
